# Task 1
**Time it took to finish task:** 1 hour and 45 minutes
## Usage
1. Open the terminal, and go to the task1 folder inside the project using `cd`. 

2. Inside the task1 folder are five files, namely: the `task1.js` file and the four input `.txt` files. To run the script and pass on one of the `.txt` files as input, run ```node task1.js [input file]```  inside the terminal. 

3. For example, if I want the `input1.txt` file as an input for the script, I will run ```node task1.js input1.txt```

**Note:** The `.txt` files inside the task1 folder contain all the sample inputs in the challenge's GitHub Gist.
